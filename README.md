This is my first app developed using the Flutter framework with the Dart Programming Language. It's also my first ever push and commit to my github repo and I am so proud of myself for learning these things. I hope to learn more with this framework and to develop my programming skill further. Honestly I feel like what I know from 2 years of Computer Science just isn't enough so I am trying to learn more technologies :D

ps. I commited this project two days ago but for some reason I couldnt upload the entire project because I was still learning git :D
